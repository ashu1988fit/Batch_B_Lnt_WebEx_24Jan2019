Object Oriented Programming Language
OOP -> It treats each real world entities as an object.
	and support 4 pillars of OOP.
Object- It is a real world entity which has
	-unique identity
	-set of properties/attributes
	-behavior
	-responsibilty
(tangible,intangible,Conceptual)
(eg: Mobile,Car,Software,Bank,Order,Account)
Class - It is a structure or a bluprint to create same type of Object
	Object is an instance of a class.
class Mobile{
	int mobileId;
	String model;
	String color;
	String memory;
	String screenSize;
//responsibity/behaviour - defining method/function
	//method has a return type, name, aruguments/parameters,body
	void printMobileDetails(){
		//printing the mobile details
	}
}
Abstraction -> shares only the relevant information about the object
Encapsultion -> hiding the complexity of an Object
Polymorphism -> Different object responding to the same method 		differently
Inheritance -> Reusability of code, Extending the proproperty of parent class to the child class

			Programming Lnguage

	1>packages      2>keywords                3>syntax
collection of related    reserved words which       way to write the 
classes                  has predefined meaning      code
or interface

1> First statement of a '.java' must be a package declaration
	(we can have one or none package declaration)
-package keyword to declare a package
-package is used to organize related class and interface in a folder/directory
-package name must be in all lower case seperated by _ underscore.
-package name must be reverse of domain name
	eg: employee project in lnt.com
	com.lnt.employee_project
	com.lnt.java_basic
Java default package is java.lang package

2> class keyword is used to declare a class in java
-a .java file can have many classes
-but can have only one public class
-and the public class name and the .java file name must be same
-we can run only that class which contains main() method
-class name must be in PascalCase(each word first letter must be in caps)
	eg: MobileShop, BankAccount, CustomerOrder
